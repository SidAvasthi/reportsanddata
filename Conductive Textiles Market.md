<p><strong>Market Overview:</strong></p>
<p>Different businesses in the chemicals and materials industries differ in size, geography, business style, and end-market focus. These businesses are part of a larger ecosystem that includes oil, gas, coal, minerals, and bio-based products as raw materials on one hand and a wide range of application industries on the other. It is traditional to divide the chemical industry into three major categories: petrochemicals, diversified manufacturers, and specialized industries.</p>
<p>While the wider patterns discussed in the previous section apply to the entire sector, the complexities of the distinctions among the various players indicate the need to analyze trends by segment of the industry. As part of its multiverse series, Deloitte classified chemical sector stakeholders into three groups: natural owners, distinctive commodities, and solution providers. Each of these groups usually has its own strategic imperatives. It is common for vertically integrated natural owners to prioritize continuous improvement over innovation when operating their businesses. By focusing on supply chain efficiency, market innovation, and cost optimization, differentiated commodities flourish in a highly fragmented and complex industry. This is exactly what solution providers do: they focus on maximizing the value of their unique products as well as their application expertise and services.</p>
